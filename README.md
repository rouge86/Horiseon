## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This was a HTML/CSS/Git Challenge: The skill to learn was refactoring, a bit like a real life job simulation.

- The motivation was to improve accessibility. 
- I built this project to reinforce skills in HTML & CSS & and how to use terminal to push, commit to a remote GitHub repository.
- I had trouble with with ssh keys early on which hampered my ability to push projects to github. With a bit of help, from my TA and TA assistant and my own trial and error I have solved this problem and learned a bunch of new terminal tricks along the way. Especially like the drag and drop feature.
- I learned how to better organise elements using semantic HTML.
- I learned the importance of accessibility from a business perspective: better SEO, more readability for fellow developers, most importantly accessibility for people with visual impairments and other disabilities. On a serious note, this would help businesses avoid litigious encounters!
- I learned how to use when it is appropriate to use class vs id, i learned when to used the aside element and figure elements. 
- I learned refactoring is actually weirdly enjoyable, like spring cleaning?


## Acceptance
*Acceptance Criteria*

### Changed several divs to semantic HTML elements
See **Header**, **Hero**, **Content**, and **Aside** elements

### HTML & CSS follow logical structure...
> * Classes were grouped within the content section, article elements unified with > **services** class as they share same styling. 
> * The same can be said about **figure** elements these were grouped with 
> **benefit** class as each figure shared the same styling. This was cleaned up 
> in the stylesheet too for more efficient code. 
> * CSS rearranged to follow a sequential order as view on the live page.
